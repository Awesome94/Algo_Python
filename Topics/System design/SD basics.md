system Design 
A few things to consider when designing Failure proof systems.

Scalability.
The capability of a process, network, or system to grow and manage increased demand.
 - Horizontal scaling:
        Scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources whereas 
    vertical scaling: 
        Means that u scale by adding more power to an existing server.

Reliability:
The probability that a system will fail in a given period. A distributed system is considered to be reliable if it keeps delivering its services even when one or several of its hardware components fail. Reliability can be achieved through redundancy of the software and data components. 

Availability:
The time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period. A simple measure of the percentage of time that a system, service or machine is remains operational under normal conditions. 

    Reliability Vs Availability.
    If a system has high reliability then it has high availability, the inverse is not true.  High availability can be maintained by minimizing repair time and ensuring that spares are always available.

Efficiency.
Efficiency can be measured through latency and throughput or bandwidth which denotes the number of items delivered in a given time unit.

Serviceability and Manageability.
How easy is it to operate and maintain. Serviceability or manageability is the simplicity and speed with which a system can be repaired or maintained.
