#### Hash Table.
This is a type of data structure in which the address or the index value of the data element is generated from a hash function.
Basically a dictionary.
    - The keys in a dictionary are hashable i.e. generated by a hashing function which generates a unique result for each unique value supplied in the function.
    - The order of the data elements in the dictionary is not fixed.
