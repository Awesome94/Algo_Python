You've been tasked with creating a customer support contact tool. When completed, this tool will allow a customer to directly reach out to customer support from within one of the 1Password apps. How would you approach this? Outline the process as well as you can. *

customer support contact tool. 
messages and calls.
1. I would create a help center dashboard to have all incoming requests/inquiries in one place where customer support can easily find them.
2. Depending on the number of customer support staff I have, each staff will be automatically assigned to a request and also customer support staff will be able to work on other requests incase they are not eganged at a given moment depending on the volume of requests available. 
3. A request will be blocked from being accessed by other customer support staff if already being worked on by someone else to avoid colision.
4. Customers will be given an estimated time to wait for response from customer service depending on the volume of requests so that they do not have to wait for unknown times to get a response.
There will be different user roles i.e. admin, client/customer, customer service(concierge) to restrict data access and roles. 
I will have the users rate the customer service agents/services in order to quickly identify areas of improvement.
